SharkDemography is a package that will run Leslie Matrix models using Monte Carlo simulations for any specified shark species. This package was developed during the publication of:

Smart, JJ, White, WT, Baje, L, et al. (2020) Can multi-species shark longline fisheries be managed sustainably using size limits? Theoretically, yes. Realistically, no. J Appl Ecol. 2020; 57: 1847â€“1860. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13659

The data and code to run the package are available on Dryad at https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.pzgmsbch4.

This code will demonstrate how to run the package and reproduce the results of Smart et al (2020). A forthcoming vignette will eventually be written based on a simplified version of these analyses.
